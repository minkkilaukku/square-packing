# square-packing
Puzzle: pack square numbers 1, 4, ..., k^2 to a mxn grid. They can go vertically, horizontally, diagonally and anti-diagonally (and each also backwards).

The Python code is copied and modified to allow dimension mxn from StackOverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3382859/solving-a-recreational-square-packing-problem#answer-6910251

The JS-code is made with the same idea from that, but I have no idea why it doesn't work as good as the Python (it won't find good solutions).
